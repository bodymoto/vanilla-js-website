## [www.helloevan.dev](https://www.helloevan.dev/)

Launched in June 2022, as a new version of [myfirstwebsite](https://github.com/boshimoto/myfirstwebsite), helloevan.dev, this website showcases my original JavaScript developments as it was rebuilt from scratch with a vanilla-only approach.<br/>
With a responsive design, interactive elements, and notable features such as an interactive drop-down menu, custom event throttling, animations based on screen position, and even a touch of Tyrion Lannister with dynamic DOM manipulation.<br/>
The site also boasts a hand-crafted logo edited with GIMP, while the contact form utilizes [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for seamless submissions.
