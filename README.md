## *This repo represents a snapshot of my progression as a developer. It is out-dated. Please visit my latest repo for a more up-to-date representation of my skillset. Thank you.*

Built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript (without the use of a library, framework, bundler, etc). The website is responsive, mobile-friendly, and interactive. It has three pages: ```home``` ```resume``` ```contact```. The contact form uses https://formspree.io/ to execute submissions. It is live hosted on GitHub.

I hope to recreate this site using a new repo sometime in the future. It was a lot of fun to work on. :>
