# hello world

Welcome to my first website. This project was built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript - without a library, framework, bundler, etc. The website is responsive, mobile-friendly, and interactive. I'm hosting it live on GitHub and I may decide to recreate it in the future using a new repo.
