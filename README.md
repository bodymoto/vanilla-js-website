# hello world

Welcome to my first website.

This project was built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript - without a library, framework, bundler, etc. The website is responsive, mobile-friendly, and interactive. It has three pages: ```home resume contact```. The contact form uses https://formspree.io/ to execute submissions. It is live hosted on GitHub.

I may decide to recreate it sometime in the future using a new repo and practical tech stack. For now, it will do.
