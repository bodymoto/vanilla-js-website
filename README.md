Launched during the second-half of 2022, this website iterated upon my first web development project - [responsive-website](https://github.com/boshimoto/responsive-website). <br />

Here, I showcase my first uses of JavaScript. Building the codebase upon a vanilla-only approach. <br />

The website has a mobile responsive design, an interactive drop-down menu, event throttling for performance, animations triggered by screen position, & uses DOM manipulation. <br />

The contact form used [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). <br />

And I hand-crafted the logo inside GIMP, represented the original registered domain of helloevan.dev <br />
