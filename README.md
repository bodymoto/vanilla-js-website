## *This repo represents a milestone in my progression as a developer. I have since moved on to more challenging work. Please visit my latest repo for a more up-to-date picture. Thank you.*

The site was built using a vanilla-only HTML/CSS/JavaScript approach - no libraries, frameworks, bundlers etc. It is responsive, mobile-friendly, and interactive. It has three pages: ```home``` ```resume``` ```contact```. The contact form uses https://formspree.io/ to execute submissions. It is live hosted on GitHub, protected by TLS.

Some notable work includes:

1. An interactive navigation bar that drops down as the user scrolls up. Also, a throttle it triggered when scrolling to help minimize the amount of events triggering, improving performance.
2. Custom animations trigger dynamically as you scroll. The trigger is determined by the position of the element relative to the users position on screen. This means the animations cannot be *broken* by adding new elements to the site.
3. A unique "square veil" was built using JavaScript async/await further down the page. I've still not seen anything like it on another website.
4. DOM manipulation exists, of course. Gotta love the DOM.
5. And I hand-created the site's logo using HTML/CSS. I then screenshot it and made my final edits in GIMP.

Again - vanilla JavaScript only! Cheers!
