The site was built using a vanilla-only HTML/CSS/JavaScript approach - no libraries, frameworks, bundlers etc. It is responsive, mobile-friendly, and interactive. It has three pages: ```home``` ```contact``` ```resume```. The contact form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to execute submissions. It is live hosted on GitHub, protected by TLS.

Notable work:

1. An interactive drop down navigation bar.
2. A 300ms throttle fires while scrolling to minimize nav scroll events.
3. Custom animations triggered while scrolling based on user screen position against html element's position.
4. A unique featured async/await and DOM manipulation event further down the page that dynamically appends new elements to the page on load and later synchronously removes each element to reveal a picture underneath.
6. The site logo was hand crafted using HTML/CSS in the browser with final edits completed in GIMP.
