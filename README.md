The site was built using a vanilla-only approach.<br/>
It is responsive, mobile-friendly, and interactive.<br/>
The contact form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to execute submissions.<br/>

Notable work:
1. An interactive drop-down menu.
2. A custom event throttle while scrolling to maximize performance.
3. Custom animations, based on screen position.
4. DOM manipulation featuring Tyrion Lannister, where elements are created and removed for a fun and unique visual effect!
6. A hand crafted site logo, edited with GIMP.
